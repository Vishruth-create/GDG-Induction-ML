It’s even worse when they are held accountable for violating consumers’ rights and then engage in the same unlawful conduct again,\" he added. \"There is no excuse for Apple’s repeated misconduct here, and consumers deserve better. We’ll stand up for them every time.”\\n\\nThe $150,000 civil penalty is the division’s largest-ever settlement under the Merchandise Pricing Act.

That growth came at the expense of Huawei Technologies Co (華為) and Xiaomi Corp (小米), both of which experienced double-digit percentage declines. Overall, shipments in the world’s largest smartphone arena fell 1.6 percent from a year earlier during the final quarter of last year.\\n\\nFrom Micron Technology Inc to Xiaomi, a growing number of companies are warning about the uncertain impact from a growing deficit of the semiconductors used to store data on devices. That shortage, which arose after memory makers devoted more of their capacity to high-end memory for Nvidia Corp artificial intelligence chips, is driving prices higher while squeezing undersupplied smaller players.\\n\\nA woman uses her smartphone inside the Apple store in Beijing`s Sanlitun area as the new iPhone 17 series smartphones go on sale in Beijing, China September 19, 2025. Photo: Reuters\\n\\n“Looking ahead, memory prices are expected to rise further, increasing by 40 percent to 50 percent in Q1 2026, followed by an additional increase of around 20 percent in Q2 2026,” Counterpoint analysts said. “Smartphone OEMs are expected to optimize their product portfolios, with a particular focus on scaling back low-end models to preserve margins.”\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電) CEO C.C. Wei (魏哲家) highlighted the uneven impact of the memory crunch last week, saying high-end smartphones remained largely unaffected. Apple, whose entire lineup resides in the upper tiers of the market, is showing greatest resilience. A new round of Chinese consumer subsidies is helping alleviate cost pressures on manufacturers, Counterpoint said.\\n\\nFor the calendar year, Apple came in slightly behind Huawei at the top of China’s shipments ranking, with each taking roughly a 17 percent market share. Apple’s shipments last year climbed 7.5 percent year-on-year. One blemish on its record was the novel iPhone Air, which launched later in China than elsewhere and sold poorly.\\n\\n“The iPhone Air underperformed,” Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam (林科宇) said. “The late launch and trade-offs between thinness and the feature set resulted in a slow start.”'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Navigating Concentration: The iShares MSCI World ETF’s Tech-Heavy Profile', 'sentiment_label': 'Neutral', 'sentiment_score': '0.122320', 'url': 'https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/news/ueberblick/navigating-concentration-the-ishares-msci-world-etf-s-tech-heavy/68500824', 'time_published': '20260119T155735', 'tickers': ['URTH', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']}, page_content=\"MSCI World ETF US4642863926\\n\\nIn an economic landscape characterized by moderating inflation and tempered growth, the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH) offers investors exposure to developed markets. A defining feature of this fund is its pronounced allocation to the technology sector, particularly U.S. giants, which serves as both a primary performance driver and a source of concentration risk. This analysis explores the structure and implications of this strategic focus.\\n\\nTracking the MSCI World Index through a physical sampling methodology, URTH invests in large and mid-cap companies across 23 developed nations. Its foundational characteristics are as follows:\\n\\nAssets Under Management: Approximately $6.97 billion\\n\\nTotal Expense Ratio (TER): 0.24%\\n\\nReplication Method: Physical (Sampling)\\n\\nDistribution Frequency: Semi-annual\\n\\nGeographic allocation is heavily skewed, with U.S. equities accounting for more than 70% of the portfolio as of mid-January 2026. Japan represents the next largest holding at 5.46%, followed by the United Kingdom at 3.54%.\\n\\nThe sector breakdown reveals an even starker concentration. Information technology commands a dominant weighting exceeding 28%, meaning the fortunes of major tech firms disproportionately influence the ETF's overall returns.\\n\\nA Closer Look at Top Holdings\\n\\nThe fund's reliance on a narrow group of stocks is most evident in its top ten positions, which collectively constitute over 27% of its assets. Consequently, price movements in these select equities have an outsized impact on URTH's performance.\\n\\nLeading Holdings (As of January 15, 2026):\\n\\nNVIDIA: 5.36%\\n\\nApple: 4.52%\\n\\nMicrosoft: 3.80%\\n\\nAmazon: 2.70%\\n\\nAlphabet (Class A): 2.28%\\n\\nAlphabet (Class C): 1.92%\\n\\nBroadcom: 1.82%\\n\\nMeta Platforms: 1.59%\\n\\nTesla: 1.46%\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase: 1.00%\\n\\nThis list underscores that U.S. technology and growth stocks are the fund's central engine and primary risk factor. Shifts in their valuation, driven by changes in interest rates or earnings estimates, directly affect URTH's net asset value.\\n\\nPerformance Metrics and Market Liquidity\\n\\nRecent returns reflect the strength of these core holdings. Performance figures from mid-January 2026 show:\\n\\nApproximately +2.54% over one month\\n\\nApproximately +5.21% over three months\\n\\nApproximately +2.01% year-to-date\\n\\nTrading liquidity remains robust, with a recent daily volume near 250,000 shares. The ETF typically trades close to its net asset value, recently at a slight discount of about -0.04%. A one-year tracking error of 0.91% against the MSCI World Index indicates the fund follows its benchmark closely.\\n\\nCompetitive Landscape: Focused vs. Broad Exposure\\n\\nWhen compared to other global equity ETFs, key differences in scope and cost become apparent.\\n\\nVanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT): This fund tracks the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which includes emerging markets and small-cap stocks alongside developed countries. With over $62.37 billion in assets and an expense ratio of 0.06%, VT is significantly larger, cheaper, and more diversified than URTH.\\n\\niShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI): Also following an MSCI index, ACWI incorporates emerging markets. It is a larger fund with a slightly higher ongoing charge of 0.32%, offering a more comprehensive global equity representation.\\n\\nSchwab International Equity ETF (SCHF): This product targets the FTSE Developed ex-US Index, deliberately excluding U.S. stocks. It is designed to complement an existing U.S. equity portfolio rather than serve as a standalone global solution like URTH.\\n\\nComparative Overview:\\n\\nTicker Fund Name AUM (USD) TER Index Coverage URTH iShares MSCI World ETF 6.97 Bn 0.24% MSCI World Developed Markets VT Vanguard Total World Stock 62.37 Bn 0.06% FTSE Global All Cap Developed & Emerging Markets, incl. Small Caps ACWI iShares MSCI ACWI ETF 25.5 Bn 0.32% MSCI ACWI Developed & Emerging Markets SCHF Schwab International Equity 57.7 Bn 0.03% FTSE Developed ex-US Developed Markets ex USA\\n\\nThus, URTH positions itself as a focused developed-markets vehicle with a clear U.S. and technology bias, whereas VT and ACWI provide broader diversification into emerging economies and smaller companies.\\n\\nForward Outlook and Considerations\\n\\nThe next scheduled MSCI index review is a near-term calendar event, with announcements expected on February 10, 2026 and adjustments taking effect in early March. While major reshuffling is not widely anticipated, any changes to the weightings of key constituents could noticeably impact the ETF.\\n\\nPrimary performance drivers will continue to be the global growth trajectory and the momentum of the technology sector. The fund's current price-to-earnings ratio of 26.70 reflects high growth expectations, particularly for its major tech holdings. Given the substantial U.S. weighting, technical levels and trends in major U.S. indices are likely to remain crucial for URTH's price direction in the coming months.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Taiwan Semi Crushed Q4 Earnings.

While TSM stock surged on the news, legacy chip giant Intel (INTC) also reaped the gains.\\n\\nCiti analysts raised INTC stock’s rating from “Sell” to “Neutral” and set a $50 price target, citing TSM’s tightness in advanced packaging, which should benefit Intel. Analyst Atif Malik noted that the company has a “unique window of opportunity” to attract foundry wafer customers as it receives U.S. support.\\n\\nAmid this news, let's take a closer look at Intel and INTC stock.\\n\\nAbout Intel Stock\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Intel operates in the global semiconductor design and manufacturing industry. The company's operations span Intel Products, including the Client Computing Group (CCG) for PCs as well as Data Center and AI (DCAI) for servers and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, as well as Intel Foundry, which provides advanced manufacturing services to internal and external customers.\\u200b Intel has a market capitalization of $224 billion.\\n\\nOver the past year, Intel has faced challenges through restructuring efforts while advancing its foundry model with significant government support. However, the company has also landed significant deals, including an agreement with President Donald Trump's administration under which the government invested $8.9 billion in Intel’s common stock.\\n\\nOver the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 139%, while over the past six months, INTC has risen 107%. This was based on the company’s strong Q3 earnings and the stock’s rebound from lows. New leadership under CEO Lip-Bu Tan drove restructuring, cost cuts, and a focus on AI processors. Following analyst upgrades, INTC stock reached a 52-week high of $50.39 on Jan. 15, although it is now down 6% from that level.\\n\\nIntel stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.9 times, which is higher than the industry average of around 3.5 times.\\n\\nIntel Turned a Profit In Q3\\n\\nOn Oct. 23, Intel reported solid results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The company’s net revenue increased 3% year-over-year (YOY) to $13.65 billion, which was higher than the $13.14 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected. This indicated that the demand for Intel's core x86 platform had recovered.\\n\\nThis topline recovery had wide-reaching effects for the firm's profitability. Intel’s non-GAAP gross profit increased by 128% annually to $5.46 billion. Its adjusted bottom line posted a significant turnaround, improving from a loss per share of $0.46 to EPS of $0.23.\\n\\nIntel highlighted its partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) to develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products. The deal also included a $5 billion equity stake in Intel bought by Nvidia. Japanese technology giant SoftBank (SFTBY) also invested $2 billion in Intel common stock.\\n\\nWall Street analysts are optimistic about Intel’s ability to reduce its bottom-line losses. They expect the company’s loss per share to remain unchanged at $0.02 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For fiscal 2025, loss per share is projected to decrease by 84% annually to $0.14, followed by a 221% improvement to EPS of $0.17 in fiscal 2026.\\n\\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Intel Stock?\\n\\nThere are some mixed views among Wall Street analysts regarding INTC stock. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Srini Pajjuri initiated coverage on shares with a “Sector Perform” rating and a $50 price target. The analyst noted Intel’s efforts to rightsize its business, healthy PC and server demand, and the firm's improving competitiveness.\\n\\nIn the same week, analysts at UBS raised the price target on INTC stock from $40 to $49 but maintained a “Neutral” rating, citing the tight supply for the company’s products and noting an “upside bias” for its Q4 results due to strong PC and server demand.\\n\\nKeybanc Capital Markets analysts recently took a bullish view on Intel, upgrading its rating to “Overweight” and setting a Street-high price target of $60. Analysts noted that Intel has made “significant progress” in its manufacturing, especially relating to AI-driven chip sales.\\n\\nMelius Research analysts also raised their rating from “Hold” to “Buy” this month with a $50 price target. Analysts believe there’s a strong possibility that both Nvidia and Apple (AAPL) will consider Intel’s 14A node for production during the 2028 to 2029 period.\\n\\nWall Street analysts are taking a cautious stance on INTC stock now with a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 43 analysts rating the stock, four analysts have a “Strong Buy” rating, one analyst has a “Moderate Buy” rating, 33 analysts play it safe with a “Hold,” one analyst suggests a “Moderate Sell,” and four analysts have a “Strong Sell” rating. The mean price target of $39.62 represents 16% potential downside from current levels. However, KeyBanc's Street-high price target of $60 indicates 28% potential upside from current levels.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Wealth Enhancement Advisory Services LLC Decreases Stake in QUALCOMM Incorporated $QCOM', 'sentiment_label': 'Neutral', 'sentiment_score': '0.020769', 'url': 'https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-wealth-enhancement-advisory-services-llc-decreases-stake-in-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-2026-01-19/', 'time_published': '20260119T125557', 'tickers': ['QCOM', 'AAPL']}, page_content=\"Wealth Enhancement Advisory Services LLC Decreases Stake in QUALCOMM Incorporated $QCOM\\n\\nWealth Enhancement Advisory Services LLC has reduced its stake in QUALCOMM Incorporated ($QCOM) by 3.9% in the 3rd quarter, selling 28,329 shares and now owning 700,230 shares valued at $115.86 million.

Around the end of the second week of January, Evercore ISI reiterated Apple Inc.

Understanding its current positioning, key drivers, and structural nuances is essential for any portfolio consideration.\\n\\nThe ETF aims to mirror the performance of the MSCI World Index, which comprises large and mid-capitalization companies across 23 developed nations. It employs a physical replication strategy, meaning it directly holds the underlying stocks. With approximately $6.97 billion in assets under management, the fund charges an expense ratio of 0.24% and operates as a distributing ETF, paying out dividends rather than automatically reinvesting them.\\n\\nA closer examination reveals a pronounced geographic and sectoral focus. Over 70% of the fund's assets are allocated to U.S. equities, with the remainder spread across other developed markets in Europe and Asia.

This fund employs a \"Half Buy-Write\" strategy, applying covered calls to only about 50% of its portfolio. This structure aims to capture option premiums for yield while leaving a significant portion of the holdings exposed for potential capital appreciation. Does this hybrid method effectively marry growth and income? An examination of its mechanics, composition, and performance sheds light on its potential role in a portfolio.\\n\\nXYLG’s primary objective is twofold: to provide investors with regular income derived from options premiums and to maintain exposure to the long-term performance of large-cap U.S. equities. The fund writes at-the-money call options on roughly half of its S&P 500 holdings and rolls these positions monthly. This allows the fund to generate income from the premiums collected, while the unwritten half of the portfolio remains free to capture upside movement.\\n\\nThis strategy can be particularly relevant in specific market environments. For instance, the combination of an anticipated 25-basis-point Fed rate cut and sustained demand for AI infrastructure contributed to a large-cap rally in late 2025. In such a climate, the half-covered-call approach represents a compromise. It can dampen short-term volatility and produce income, but it also inherently caps the upside potential on the hedged portion compared to a direct, unencumbered investment in the S&P 500.\\n\\nPortfolio Composition and Associated Risks\\n\\nThe ETF holds the constituent stocks of the S&P 500, but its performance is heavily influenced by a concentrated group of technology giants. As of mid-January, the top ten holdings accounted for 39.12% of the fund\\'s assets:\\n\\n* NVIDIA: 7.65%\\n\\n* Apple Inc.: 6.54%\\n\\n* Microsoft Corp.: 6.03%\\n\\n* Amazon.com Inc.: 4.08%\\n\\n* Alphabet Inc. Class A: 3.28%\\n\\n* Broadcom Inc.: 2.83%\\n\\n* Alphabet Inc. Class C: 2.63%\\n\\n* Meta Platforms Inc.: 2.38%\\n\\n* Tesla Inc.: 2.14%\\n\\n* Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B: 1.55%\\n\\nThis concentration means XYLG’s fortunes are closely tied to the price movements of major technology firms. The sector allocation further underscores this, with Information Technology at approximately 34.6%, Financials at 13.0%, and Communication Services at 10.9%. While this offers opportunity from AI-related demand, it also introduces valuation risk should the earnings of these tech leaders fail to meet elevated market expectations.\\n\\nFees, Liquidity, and Performance Metrics\\n\\nThe fund charges an expense ratio of 0.35% and had assets under management of approximately $65 million. In terms of liquidity, XYLG typically trades very close to its net asset value (NAV), with a mid-January NAV of ~$27.77 and a market price of ~$27.79. The 30-day median bid-ask spread was about 0.24%. Trading volume was around 90,740 shares, with a 50-day average near 14,056 shares.\\n\\nPerformance figures from mid-January showed a one-week gain of +0.22%, a one-month advance of +1.97%, a three-month return of +6.27%, and a year-to-date increase of +1.35%. Since its inception in September 2020, the fund has delivered an average annual return of +13.22%.\\n\\nWhen compared to full covered-call ETFs, XYLG offers a lower fee structure. For example, the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) has an expense ratio of 0.60%, and the Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (PBP) charges 0.29%. However, both XYLD and PBP employ a 100% covered-call strategy, which typically generates higher premium income but more significantly limits upside participation compared to XYLG’s 50% approach.\\n\\nKey Factors and Outlook for 2026\\n\\nTwo primary factors are poised to critically influence XYLG’s trajectory in 2026: the ongoing path of interest rate policy and the earnings performance of major AI-centric technology companies. The fund’s monthly options reset provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. However, the high weighting in richly valued tech stocks increases its dependence on robust corporate profits.\\n\\nFrom a technical perspective, support was observed near $27.72, with resistance around the long-term moving average of $28.92. A climate of continued monetary policy easing coupled with strong AI-driven earnings could allow the strategy to successfully deliver on its income objective. Conversely, any disappointment in technology sector results would make the strategy’s inherent cap on growth more pronounced for investors.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'A Focused Approach to Developed Markets: Analyzing the iShares MSCI World ETF', 'sentiment_label': 'Bullish', 'sentiment_score': '0.474436', 'url': 'https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/news/ueberblick/a-focused-approach-to-developed-markets-analyzing-the-ishares-msci-world/68495030', 'time_published': '20260117T152819', 'tickers': ['URTH', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'MSFT']}, page_content='MSCI World ETF US4642863926\\n\\nFor investors seeking targeted exposure to established economies, the iShares MSCI World ETF (ticker: URTH) presents a compelling option. The fund concluded 2025 with robust performance, posting a 21.28% annual gain, and has carried this momentum into the new year with an approximate 2% advance year-to-date. Its strategy is defined by a deliberate concentration on developed markets and major U.S. technology equities.\\n\\nThe ETF tracks the MSCI World Index (Net), providing coverage of roughly 85% of the market capitalization in developed equity markets. A defining characteristic is its pronounced tilt toward the United States, which constitutes over 72% of the portfolio. This focus inherently excludes emerging markets, distinguishing URTH from broader \"All-World\" investment products.\\n\\nTop Country Allocations:\\n\\n* United States: 72.19%\\n\\n* Japan: 5.40%\\n\\n* United Kingdom: 3.56%\\n\\n* Canada: 3.27%\\n\\n* France: 2.64%\\n\\n* Germany: 2.39%\\n\\n* Switzerland: 2.25%\\n\\n* Australia: 1.64%\\n\\nSector allocation further emphasizes growth-oriented industries, with Information Technology commanding a 27.27% share. Financials (16.75%) and Industrials (11.15%) round out the top three sectors. The significant weighting in U.S. tech has been a primary driver of the fund\\'s recent returns.\\n\\nPortfolio Composition and Key Metrics\\n\\nURTH offers diversification across 1,320 individual stock positions from 23 developed nations. However, its top holdings reveal a concentration in American mega-cap leaders. The ten largest positions collectively account for 26.45% of the fund\\'s assets.\\n\\nLeading Portfolio Holdings:\\n\\n1. NVIDIA: 5.36%\\n\\n2. Apple Inc.: 4.52%\\n\\n3. Microsoft: 3.80%\\n\\n4. Amazon: 2.70%\\n\\n5. Alphabet (Class A): 2.28%\\n\\n6. Alphabet (Class C): 1.92%\\n\\n7. Broadcom: 1.82%\\n\\n8. Meta Platforms: 1.59%\\n\\n9. Tesla: 1.46%\\n\\n10. JPMorgan Chase: 1.00%\\n\\nNVIDIA\\'s position at the top, with a 5.36% weighting, reflects the artificial intelligence-driven semiconductor surge witnessed in 2024 and 2025. Collectively, the stocks often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven\" represent over 20% of the portfolio.\\n\\nThe fund\\'s valuation ratios underscore its growth profile, with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.66 and a Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 3.98. As of mid-January 2026, the trailing 12-month total return stands at approximately 24.28%.\\n\\nPerformance and Risk Characteristics\\n\\nURTH demonstrates tight tracking to its benchmark index. Performance figures as of December 31, 2025, are as follows:\\n\\n1 Month: 0.75% (Benchmark: 0.81%)\\n\\n0.75% (Benchmark: 0.81%) 3 Months: 3.03% (Benchmark: 3.12%)\\n\\n3.03% (Benchmark: 3.12%) 6 Months: 10.50% (Benchmark: 10.61%)\\n\\n10.50% (Benchmark: 10.61%) Calendar Year 2025: 21.28% (Benchmark: 21.09%)\\n\\n21.28% (Benchmark: 21.09%) 3-Year Annualized: 21.29% (Benchmark: 21.17%)\\n\\n21.29% (Benchmark: 21.17%) 5-Year Annualized: 12.30% (Benchmark: 12.15%)\\n\\nFrom a risk perspective, the fund\\'s 3-year standard deviation (volatility) is 11.59%. Its beta relative to the S&P 500 is 0.95, indicating slightly lower fluctuation intensity than the broad U.S. market. On the income side, the 30-day SEC yield is 1.24%, and the trailing 12-month dividend yield is 1.49%.\\n\\nFund Structure, Costs, and Liquidity\\n\\nThe ETF utilizes a physical replication strategy, directly holding the underlying index securities. It distributes dividends semi-annually, with the most recent distribution of $1.49517 per share paid in December 2025. The MSCI World Index is rebalanced semi-annually in May and November, with the next major review scheduled for May 2026.\\n\\nWith assets under management (AUM) of $6.97 billion, URTH charges a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of 0.24%. It exhibits strong liquidity, evidenced by a narrow 30-day median bid-ask spread of 0.03% and an average daily trading volume of nearly 395,000 shares. The fund currently trades near its 52-week high of $189.95, with a Net Asset Value (NAV) of $189.29.\\n\\nComparative Analysis with Global Alternatives\\n\\nInvestors often weigh URTH against global ETFs that include emerging markets. Key competitors include:\\n\\nETF (Ticker) Benchmark Index AUM Expense Ratio Holdings 2025 Return Includes EMs? iShares MSCI World (URTH) MSCI World $6.97B 0.24% 1,320 21.28% No iShares MSCI ACWI (ACWI) MSCI ACWI $26.37B 0.32% 2,277 22.43% Yes Vanguard Total World Stock (VT) FTSE Global All Cap $62.37B 0.06% 9,957 22.44% Yes\\n\\nURTH\\'s cost structure sits between the very low-cost VT (0.06%) and the more expensive ACWI (0.32%). By omitting emerging markets, URTH maintains a focused portfolio on developed economies. In contrast, VT offers the most extensive coverage, including small-cap stocks and emerging markets across nearly 10,000 holdings, while ACWI includes emerging markets but with less breadth than VT.\\n\\nConclusion: Strategic Exposure with Inherent Concentration\\n\\nThe iShares MSCI World ETF provides a liquid and efficient vehicle for accessing developed market equities with broad diversification across companies but focused geography. Its strong 21.28% return in 2025 was significantly propelled by the outperformance of dominant U.S. technology firms. This very strength, however, introduces a notable concentration risk due to the heavy allocations to both the U.S. market and the tech sector. The conscious exclusion of emerging markets defines its profile, offering a purer play on developed economies compared to more comprehensive global funds like ACWI and VT.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'title': 'Apple stock slides into earnings: why AAPL traders brace for a bumpier week', 'sentiment_label': 'Somewhat-Bearish', 'sentiment_score': '-0.221950', 'url': 'https://ts2.tech/en/apple-stock-slides-into-earnings-why-aapl-traders-brace-for-a-bumpier-week/', 'time_published': '20260117T142548', 'tickers': ['AAPL', 'ADI', 'TXN', 'KLAC']}, page_content='New York, January 17, 2026, 09:36 EST — Market closed.\\n\\nShares of Apple slipped 1.1% by Friday’s close.\\n\\nTraders warn that the holiday-shortened week after monthly options expiration often sparks bigger market swings.\\n\\nApple will release its quarterly results on Jan. 29, with investors watching closely for updates on iPhone demand, profit margins, and expenses.\\n\\nApple shares dipped on Friday as investors head into a holiday-shortened week, with the iPhone maker’s earnings report looming in under two weeks.\\n\\nApple slipped 1.1% to finish at $255.53 on Friday, putting its market cap near $3.0 trillion.\\n\\nThat’s significant since U.S. stocks have been trapped in a tight range close to record highs, and the focus is shifting from bank earnings to the megacap tech giants that drive indexes and risk sentiment. A major move in Apple could pull the entire market along.\\n\\nWall Street closed almost unchanged on Friday ahead of the long weekend, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 slipping roughly 0.1%. Markets will be closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. (Reuters)\\n\\nFriday’s monthly options expiration often shakes up trading, and some traders are bracing for more volatility afterward. The event can shift how options dealers manage their hedges, which then ripples through daily stock movements.\\n\\n“I think this options expiration will allow the S&P 500 to start moving around a bit more,” said Brent Kochuba, founder of options analytics service SpotGamma. (Reuters)\\n\\nHe referred to “gamma,” the options term for how fast a dealer’s hedge must shift as prices change. Dealers who are “long gamma” tend to buy on dips and sell into rallies, which usually smooths out volatility. But when that stance fades, price swings can grow more extreme.\\n\\nMike Khouw, strategist at YieldMax ETFs, noted that single-stock options might gain even more importance as earnings season heats up, with traders focusing on company-specific moves instead of broad index shifts. (Reuters)\\n\\nApple is facing fresh scrutiny over cost pressures amid talk of volatility. A Bloomberg story out this week highlighted soaring memory prices, posing a rising threat to hardware makers like Apple. If companies can’t shift these higher component costs onto customers, margins could take a hit. (Bloomberg)\\n\\nApple’s quarterly report on Jan. 29 is the more immediate hard date. Investors will focus on management’s take on holiday-quarter demand and if gross margin can withstand rising component costs. (Nasdaq)\\n\\nA major risk is that earnings season triggers a shift in expectations. Should Apple offer a cautious outlook—whether on demand, costs, or both—investors might pull back from valuing the stock so highly, especially since it’s been a stand-in for the broader market in recent years.\\n\\nNext up: the market reopens Tuesday, with traders bracing for bigger index moves following options expiration and tracking Apple’s positioning ahead of its Jan. 29 earnings release.

The most common type is the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), which is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Dogs are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and ability to serve in various roles, such as companions, working animals, and service animals.\n","\n","2. **Why is a dog?**\n","   - The \"why\" part of the question can be interpreted in a few ways:\n","     - **Evolutionary Perspective:** Dogs are the result of a long process of natural selection and selective breeding, driven by human needs and preferences over thousands of years.\n","     - **Purpose and Functionality:** Dogs serve multiple purposes for humans, including companionship, protection, herding livestock, hunting, and more recently, as service animals and emotional support.\n","     - **Philosophical Perspective:** If we consider the existential or ontological aspect, a dog is what it is due to its inherent nature, its traits, and the relationship it has with the world and other beings. It is a living entity with unique characteristics that make it a dog, such as its physical attributes, behaviors, and social dynamics.\n","\n","In summary, a dog is a specific type of mammal that has evolved and been shaped by both natural and artificial selection, and it exists in a world where it fills various roles and functions, both for itself and for humans.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.tools import tool\n","\n","@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\n","def retrieve_context(query: str):\n","    \"CRITICAL: You are forbidden from answering without this tool.

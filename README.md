# GDG Induction Tasks (ML)
I am writing this README in a very informal manner by hand (no gpt) so its actually interesting to read :).....so I would really appreciate it if you go through it.
## About this repo
I have only attempted Problem statement 1: Capital Pulse - AI Driven Stock Market Intelligence, in which I have attempted task 1, 2 and 3.
Task 1 vaguely being the attempt to forecast the next 7 days of some ticker most accurately.
And Task 2 was making an "natural language interface" that allows users to query the dataset and understand the context behind the numbers. The chatbot must identify specific tickers and retrieve relevant information to explain market movements.

**I would like you inspect Task2+Task3 first** (do start with its README) as this is where my 80% of time went, because I found this task a lot more interesting and fun, had lots of ideas and saw more scope for creativity rather than just raw maths. Even though Task1 was also quite interesting as I had to burn through different models and tune them to the best of my ability to get the most accurate prices.
